This folder contains different examples of scripts and possible outputs trying to convert .pdf files into .html (to come: .xml or .tag formats)

Those examples use already downloaded pdfs from 'pdfs-downloaded' folder - find them in 'scrape_articles'

-doc-cr1701.pdf and -doc-cr1701.html is an exmaple of succesful conversion.

Conversion of -doc-_cr1606.pdf ran into an issue of freezing script (no error shown) when trying to process horizontal layout of tables (page 60)
